<h1>LINQ</h1>

<section>
<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>
<p>LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query. It was invented by microsoft so you can query objects.
But also you can queries XML, any relational DBs and NoSQL DBs like mongodb. No matter what
the source is you will use the exact same code to write queries. With LINQ the queries will be automatically
translated in the language that is supported by the data store.
</p>

<h3>LINQ and Entity framework</h3>

<ol>
<li>No more SQL queries/stored procedures(we can use pure C# CODE)</li>
<li>Increased productivity(don't have to change languages according to environment)</li>
<li>Though LINQ is powerful you will have eventually to use SQL queries for something more complicated</li>

</ol>

<h2>Getting data from database</h2>
<ol>
<li>first use the namespace using System.Linq;</li>
<li>Create an instance of our Db context
<pre>var context = new PlutoContext();</pre>

</li>
<li><strong>LINQ syntax(better for programmers who are used in SQL queries)</strong><br>
<pre>
            var query =
                from c in context.Courses
                where c.Name.Contains("c#")
                orderby c.Name
                select c;

            foreach (var item in query)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("C# related courses are :" + item.Name);
            }</pre>

<ol>
<li>from and in are LINQ keywords/operators</li>
<li>c temporary variable for our queries</li>
<li>then context.Courses is the source of our data</li>
<li>last line always select</li>
<li>So with the above code we are saying from table courses, that have in their name C#, order by Name and then
we iterate and display all courses in console
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Restriction operators ...where...</strong>
<pre>           var query2 =
                from c in context.Courses
                where c.Level == 1 && c.Author.Id == 1
                select c;</pre>


</li>

<li><strong>Ordering ...orderby...</strong>
<pre>           var query3 =
                from c in context.Courses
                where  c.Author.Id == 1
				orderby c.Level descending, c.Name
                select c;</pre>


</li>

<li><strong>Projection(return only specific properties/columns by anonymous types)in a new class that only has in our
example Name and Author</strong>
<pre>           var query4 =
                from c in context.Courses
                where  c.Author.Id == 1
				orderby c.Level descending, c.Name
                select new{Name = c.Name, Author = c.Author.Name};</pre>


</li>

<li><strong>Grouping ...group by into...(it's different from the one we use in SQL,it is used to break down
a list of objects into one or more groups, we declare a new variable that will have the group. The result
is a list of groups which eah group is an enum)</strong>
<pre>            var query5 =
                from c in context.Courses
                group c by c.Level into g
                select g;

            foreach (var group in query5)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(group.Key);

                foreach (var course in group)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("\t{0}",course.Name);
                }
            }</pre>
It returns the groups by level<br>
<img src="group_by.jpg"><br>
<div>Or if we want to see how many each group has:</div>
<pre>
Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}",group.Key,group.Count());
</pre>
</li>

<li><strong>Joining ...Inner Join...Group Join...Cross Join...
(With LINQ you don't have to use an Inner Join)</strong>
<pre>	    //Inner join
	    var query6 =
                from c in context.Courses
                select new { CourseName = c.Name, AuthorName = c.Author.Name };

            foreach (var course in query6)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(course.CourseName);
                Console.WriteLine(course.AuthorName);
            }

	    //Same as above if we don't have the relation in our entity model
            var query6 =
                from c in context.Courses
                join a in context.Authors on c.AuthorId equals a.Id
                select new { CourseName = c.Name, AuthorName = a.Name };
</pre>
</li>

<li><strong>...Group Join...
It's used like left join(SELECT A.Name From Authors A LEFT JOIN Courses C ON A.AuthorID = C.AuthorID</strong>
<pre>            //Group join
            //How many courses each author has
            var query7 =
                from a in context.Authors
                join c in context.Courses on a.Id equals c.AuthorId into g
                select new { AuthorName = a.Name, Courses = g.Count() };

            foreach (var x in query7)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}",x.AuthorName,x.Courses);

            }
</pre>


</li>

<li><strong>...Cross Join or Cartesian Join...
It's used like cross join in SQL</strong>
<pre>            var query8 =
                from a in context.Authors
                from c in context.Courses
                select new { AuthorName = a.Name, CourseName = c.Name };

            foreach (var x in query8)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", x.AuthorName, x.CourseName);

            }
</pre>


</li>



<li><strong>Extension methods(better for programmers who are used in lambda expressions, delegates, actions.
Also some queries can't be written with LINQ syntax so you have to use this approach)</strong>

<pre>
            var courses = context.Courses
                .Where(c => c.Name
                .Contains("c#"))
                .OrderBy(c => c.Name);

            foreach (var course in courses)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("C# related courses are :" + course.Name);
            }

</pre></li>
</ol>

  <h2>Extension Methods</h2>

  <p>Wnenever we see a Func we can use a lambda expression.
    <img src="Func_and_Lambda_Expression.jpg">
  </p>

  <h3>1. Restriction</h3>
  <pre>            var context = new PlutoContext();

            var coursesLevel1 = context.Courses.Where(c => c.Level == 1);

            foreach (var result in coursesLevel1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(result.Name);
            }</pre>


  <h3>2. Ordering</h3>

  <p>We have OrderBy, OrderByDescending, OrderByAscending, ThenBy, ThenByDescending, ThenByAscending</p>

  <pre>            var context = new PlutoContext();

            var coursesLevel1 = context.Courses
                .Where(c => c.Level == 1).OrderByDescending(c=> c.Name)
                .ThenByDescending(c=> c.Level);

            foreach (var result in coursesLevel1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(result.Name);
            }
</pre>


  <h3>3. Projection</h3>

  <p>Since we have a navigation property ...Author... we don't need a join as you see below.</p>
  

  <pre>            var context = new PlutoContext();

            var coursesLevel1 = context.Courses
                .Where(c => c.Level == 1).OrderByDescending(c=> c.Name)
                .ThenByDescending(c=> c.Level)
                .Select(c=> new { CourseName =c.Name , AuthorName = c.Author.Name });

            foreach (var result in coursesLevel1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(result.CourseName);
                Console.WriteLine(result.AuthorName);
            }
</pre>

<p>If we use Select and target property that is a list we will end up with a list of list. So we will need a foreach inside foreach.</p>


<pre>            //IQueryable is simply a list inside a list so we need a forach inside foreach
            var coursesTags = context.Courses
                .Where(c => c.Level == 1).OrderByDescending(c => c.Name)
                .ThenByDescending(c => c.Level)
                .Select(c => c.Tags );

            foreach (var c in coursesTags)
            {
                foreach (var tag in c)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(tag.Name);
                }
            }
</pre>

<pre> //To fix the above
            var tags = context.Courses
                .Where(c => c.Level == 1).OrderByDescending(c => c.Name)
                .ThenByDescending(c => c.Level)
                .SelectMany(c => c.Tags);
            Console.WriteLine("*****Course Tags with SelectMany***** \n");
            foreach (var t in tags)
            {
                
                    Console.WriteLine(t.Name);
                
            }

            Console.WriteLine();
</pre>

  <h3>4. Set Operators</h3>

  <p>Return unique results with Distinct.</p>
  

  <pre>            var uniqueTags = context.Courses
                .Where(c => c.Level == 1).OrderByDescending(c => c.Name)
                .ThenByDescending(c => c.Level)
                .SelectMany(c => c.Tags)
                .Distinct();
            Console.WriteLine("*****Unique Tags with SelectMany and Distinct ***** \n");
            foreach (var t in uniqueTags)
            {

                Console.WriteLine(t.Name);

            }
            Console.WriteLine();
</pre>

  <h3>5. Grouping</h3>

  <p>GroupBy is used when we want to split resulsts in groups. Each group has a property called key.</p>
  

  <pre>             var groups = context.Courses.GroupBy(c => c.Level);

            Console.WriteLine("*****Grouping and GroupBy ***** \n");

            foreach (var group in groups)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Key " + group.Key);
                foreach (var course in group)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(course.Name);
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
</pre>


<h3>6. Joins</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Inner Join(When there is no relationship between objects and we want to relate them). As shown in the image what 
        property of the Course class we want to use in order to join it with authors.
    </li>
    <img src="inner_join.jpg">
    <pre>            //Inner Join
            //We are usingCourses with Authors with their Id and we get the course name and author name
            var courses = context.Courses.Join(context.Authors, 
                c => c.AuthorId, 
                a => a.Id, 
                (course, author) => new
                {
                    CourseName = course.Name,
                    AuthorName = author.Name
                });

            Console.WriteLine("*****Inner Join ***** \n");

            foreach (var course in courses)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Course: "+ course.CourseName);
                Console.WriteLine("Author: " +course.AuthorName); 
            }
            Console.WriteLine();</pre>
    <li>Group Join(It's useful when in SQL we do a left join and then use count and Group By)</li>
    <pre>            //All authors and count their courses with GroupJoin
            var coursesForAuthors= context.Authors.GroupJoin(context.Courses, a => a.Id, c => c.AuthorId, (author, allCourses) => new
            {
                AuthorName = author.Name,
                Courses = allCourses.Count()

            });

            Console.WriteLine("*****GroupJoin ***** \n");

            foreach (var course in coursesForAuthors)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("{0} has {1} courses",course.AuthorName,course.Courses);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();</pre>
    <li>Cross Join(or cartesian join)</li>
  </ul>
  

  <pre>            //Cross Join
            //Give all authors all courses
            var allCoursesToAuthors = context.Authors.SelectMany(a => context.Courses, (author, course) => new
            {

                AuthorName = author.Name,
                CourseName = course.Name
            });
</pre>

  <h3>7. Partitioning</h3>

  <p>It's useful when we want to return a page of records. So if we want to display courses skip first 5  and the size of each page is 10.
  </p>
  

  <pre>var limitResults = context.Courses.OrderBy(c => c.Name).Skip(5).Take(10);

            foreach (var item in limitResults)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
            }
</pre>

<h3>8. Element Operators</h3>

  <p>Return a single object or the first object in the list. By default they are shortened by primary key.
    With <strong>First</strong> if this course is table or this course list is empty you will get an exception. So we use 
    <strong>FirsrOrDefault</strong> and it's going to return null. Also we have Last or LastOrDefault
  </p>
  

  <pre>            //First course that it's price is bigger than 20 
            var firstCourse = context.Courses.OrderBy(c => c.Name).FirstOrDefault(c => c.FullPrice > 20);

            Console.WriteLine(firstCourse.Name);

            Console.WriteLine();

            
</pre>

<p><strong>Last CAN'T  be used with SQL database but only when working with data. </strong>
If you want to achieve that you short them in a descending way and then choose the first one.
</p>

<p>We have also have Single and SingleOrDefault which will return a singel .</p>


<pre>            var singleCourse = context.Courses.Single(c => c.Id == 1);

            Console.WriteLine(singleCourse.Name);</pre>


<h3>9. Qualifying</h3>

  <p><strong>All</strong> returns a boolean. We also have <strong>Any</strong> which asks if we have any courses 
    that satisfy this criteria.
    
  </p>
  

  <pre>            var expensiveCourses = context.Courses.All(c => c.FullPrice > 20);

            Console.WriteLine(expensiveCourses);

            var anyCoursesAbove30 = context.Courses.Any(c => c.FullPrice > 30);

            Console.WriteLine(anyCoursesAbove30);

            
</pre>

<h3>10. Aggregating</h3>

  <p><strong>Count</strong> just counts how many are in the database. <strong>Max</strong> finds the highest, <strong>Min</strong>finds the lowest, <strong>Average</strong> counts the avrage.
    
  </p>
  

  <pre>            var countAllCourses = context.Courses.Count(c=>c.FullPrice >100);

            Console.WriteLine("We have {0} total courses above 100$",countAllCourses);

            Console.WriteLine();

            var mostExpensiveCourse = context.Courses.Max(c=> c.FullPrice);

            Console.WriteLine("Most expensive price "+mostExpensiveCourse);

            var cheapestCourse = context.Courses.Min(c => c.FullPrice);

            Console.WriteLine("Cheapest price "+ cheapestCourse);

            var averageCoursePrice = context.Courses.Average(c => c.FullPrice);

            Console.WriteLine("The average of all courses is " + averageCoursePrice);


            
</pre>

<section>
    
<h2>Deferred Execution</h2>

<p>To see what queries we run you can check SQL server profiler as shown in Chapter 3. Queries are not executed at the time you create them but when one fo these situations happens.</p>
<h4>Query executed when</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Iterating over query variable</li>
    <li>Calling ToList, ToArray, ToDictionary</li>
    <li>Calling First, Last, Single, Count, Max, Min, Average</li>

</ul>

<p>So this is what we call deferred execution. Queries are not executed immediately but only when needed.
One <strong>main advantage</strong> is that deferred execution enables queries to be extended.
</p>

<pre>            var context = new PlutoContext();

            var courses = context.Courses;

            var filtered = courses.Where(c => c.Level == 1);

            var sorted = filtered.OrderBy(c => c.Name);

            foreach (var course in sorted)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(course.Name);
            }</pre>

<p>It <strong>isn't recommended</strong> to store different queries in different values but we should chain the methods we want.</p>

<p>There are times though that we need to execute a query because your queries cannot be translated to SQL. Check DeferredExecution project

</p>

<pre>
            var allBeginnerCourses = context.Courses.Where(c => c.isBeginnerCourse == true);

            //Throws invalid error exception
            //This is because isBeginnerCourse is a custom property and LINQ doesn;t know how 
            //to translate it to SQL
            foreach (var course in allBeginnerCourses)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(course.Name);
            }

</pre>

<p>To fix it we use <strong>immediate execution.</strong> This though has an impact in our application since we load all our courses from the database just to filter them in memory. In smaller applications it isn't noticeable.</p>
<pre>            var allBeginnerCourses = context.Courses.ToList().Where(c => c.isBeginnerCourse == true);
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Immediate Execution");
            foreach (var course in allBeginnerCourses)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(course.Name);
            }
</pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>IQueryable</h2>
    <p>IQueryable is an interface that derives from IEnuremable. Allows queries to be extended without being immediately executed. As we see in our project IQueryableExample since we stored it in an IQueryable the filter is part of the query.
    With IQueryable all expressions will be translated to SQL code and run together as a single SQL query.

        <pre>            var context = new PlutoContext();

            IQueryable<Course> courses = context.Courses;

            var filtered = courses.Where(c => c.Level == 1);

            foreach (var course in filtered)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(course.Name);
            }</pre>
        <img src="iqueryable_explained.jpg">
    </p>

    <h3>IEnumerable</h3>
    <p>IEnumerable is an interface that represents any object that can be enumerated. In simple terms 
        it means that we can iterate over them using a for each block in C#.

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>string(we can have access to each character with a foreach)</li>
        <li>array</li>
        <li>list</li>
        <li>dictionary</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If we use IEnumerable each expression will called and used immediately one by one so that makes the app heavier.</p>
