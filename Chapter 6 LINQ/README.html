<h2>What is LINQ?</h2
<p>LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query. It was invented by microsoft so you can query objects.
But also you can queries XML, any relational DBs and NoSQL DBs like mongodb. No matter what 
the source is you will use the exact same code to write queries. With LINQ the queries will be automatically
translated in the language that is supported by the data store.

<h3>LINQ and Entity framework</h3>

<ol>
<li>No more SQL queries/stored procedures(we can use pure C# CODE)</li>
<li>Increased productivity(don't have to change languages according to environment)</li>
<li>Though LINQ is powerful you will have eventually to use SQL queries for something more complicated</li>

</ol>
